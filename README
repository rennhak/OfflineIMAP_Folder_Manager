OfflineIMAP Folder Manager
--------------------------

OfflineIMAP [1] is a fantastic tool written in Python which helps to keep a local copy in sync with
a remote server via IMAP (and vice versa). Unfortunately, one small problem exists [2].

That is quite annoying, since when you create a new folder locally to store mails this will NOT be
synced to the server. This simple script supports a quick solution for this problem.


TODO
----

Write a proper patch for OfflineIMAP to support this.
